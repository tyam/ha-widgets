title: Overview of hw-widgets
layout: default
root: ./
---

hw-widgets is a UI library for creating web applications with hyperapp.

- Since the library itself manages the state of GUI parts, it can be separated from the state of the domain
- We use flex layout widely and can lay out GUI parts simply and declaratively
- Mobile-first, supports major browsers including IE11
- The style is written in scss and can be customized separately from the program
